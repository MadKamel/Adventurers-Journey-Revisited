# Adventurer's Journey Revisited
This project is an attempt to revise my earlier text-adventure games to make them more fun to play.

So far, I have created an actor management system. It allows for attacking enemies, getting damaged by enemies, and enemy movement. So far, I have not implemented these functions into the game itself. I plan for the end result to look something like a dungeon exploration game, in which you can move through rooms lined up along the four cardinal directions, however I have not started work on this part, yet.
